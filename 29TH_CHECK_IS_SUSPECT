the 29th check in the "simple shell 0.3" task copies the ls command into the working directory,
then it deletes the PATH and tries to execute ls. The expected output is for your shell to say
that ls doesnt exist, but it should. in our shell and in the sh program, even with no path
the command will execute if it is in the current directory.
